# Programming puzzles
- Used to prepare for a programming job interview.
- Comments are sparse/non-existent, but added as needed.

- Used pure Python whenever possible (i.e., no modules imported).
	- Exception: NumPy to create test data sets of random numbers.

- Average difficulty is similar to difficulty of the actual test, in that:
	- The solution is usually simple in hindsight.
	- But finding the right solution can be immensely difficult under time pressure.
