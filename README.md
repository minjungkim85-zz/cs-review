# Programming puzzles
- I used these to prepare for a programming job interview.
- I tried to use pure Python whenever possible.
	- Exception: To create test data sets, I used NumPy.

- I would consider the average difficulty of these puzzles to be similar to the difficulty of the programming test, in that: 
	- The solution is usually simple in hindsight.
	- But under the time pressure of a programming test, finding the right solution can be immensely difficult.
